//! Catalog of ISO/IEC 14496-12 boxes, each decoded into a value that owns its bytes
//!
//! A box in this crate implements the traits `isobmff-core` defines, so it
//! reads with [`BoxDecode`](isobmff_core::BoxDecode) and writes with
//! [`BoxWrite`](isobmff_core::BoxWrite) like any other box.
//!
//! # `no_std`
//!
//! The crate is `no_std` but needs `alloc`: every box owns what it was read
//! from, and a container owns the children it holds.
